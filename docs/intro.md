# resmi

resmi (Resilient Mobility Infrastructure) is a tool designed to use open data for the management and maintenance of urban mobility infrastructure.

Utilizing a wide array of data sources and standards (OpenStreetMap, GTFS, GBFS, ...) resmi tries to provide a dynamic and comprehensive overview of transportation networks. By leveraging up-to-date, community-contributed open data, resmi ensures that experts have access to reliable information, aiding in the effective maintenance and enhancement of urban mobility systems. More information in the respective pages.

```{tab-item} Asset inventory

<br>

The data can be used to create informative charts for decision makers. Below can be seen the missing data for cycling segments, or the surface can be mapped.​

```{tab-item} Scheduled fieldwork

<br>

When done early in the year, the scheduling can allow better planning. This can be done for each sector, helping prioritization, and **better allocation of budget**.​

```{tab-item} Report issues

<br>

Reporting of issues can be done directly by mapping area and defining asset type – and then the assets in that area can be marked to be audited. Public later.​

```{tab-item} Events and scenarios

<br>

In case of historical events, the assets closest to the event need to be extracted and assigned the event. This will be later used for estimations of costs. ​
