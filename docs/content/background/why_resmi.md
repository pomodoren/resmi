# Why resmi?

There are multiple issues that happen with mobility maintenance that force cities to have a tool that handles managing mobility infrastructure.

```{tab-item} Slow institutions, fast city

<br>

When interacting with institutions, some of them have data and processes, but most are not consistent enough for proactive solutions. **Issues define priorities.​**

```{tab-item} Fixing infrastructure

<br>

Mobility infrastructure fixes often happens ad-hoc, so it takes time, and often reduces in priority once that management is not overlooking. **No time for planning.​**

```{tab-item} Hidden fragility hurts

<br>

Projections on infrastructure status are based on many assumptions, and do not consider events that might reduce quality non-visibly. **Proactive interventions needed.​**

```{tab-item} Faster practices

<br>

Our target is to help cities improve and plan better mobility interventions through data. This will increase resilience and change attitude on interventions.​

```{tab-item} Start with Open Data

<br>

**OpenStreetMap** is a base map that contains standardized info on the infra and services of the city, all crowdsourced from volunteers. Check your city!​
